# Track — Improvement Plan (multi-session)

Master plan for the next evolution of Track. Each phase is sized for roughly one session.
Companion docs: [DESIGN_PROMPT.md](./DESIGN_PROMPT.md) (UI rework, phase 3) and [WATCH_PLAN.md](./WATCH_PLAN.md) (Apple Watch, phase 4).

## Phase 1 — New activity types: Run & Swim ✅ (done 2026-07-11)

Current types: `Ride`, `Walk`, `Football`. Add **`Run`** and **`Swim`**.
The type is a plain string in the Flutter app and an enum in ActivitiesJournal — both sides must change in the same phase or uploads of the new types fail model binding.

### Track app (Flutter)

- [x] `test/auto_pause_config_test.dart` — failing tests for `Run` and `Swim` configs (test-first)
- [x] `lib/services/auto_pause_config.dart` — add cases:
  - **Run**: auto-pause enabled. Pause below ~2 km/h, resume above ~4 km/h — walking breaks (4–5 km/h) still count as moving; only standing still pauses. Accuracy filter 20 m.
  - **Swim**: auto-pause **disabled** (GPS speed is unreliable in water — fixes only arrive when the antenna surfaces). Relaxed accuracy filter (~50 m) so sparse open-water fixes are still recorded.
- [x] `lib/screens/record_screen.dart` — add `Run`, `Swim` to the type picker (line ~458)
- [x] `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` — icons: `Icons.directions_run`, `Icons.pool` (switch at line ~114)
- [x] `flutter test` green

**Scope note — swimming:** phone-based swim tracking is open-water only (phone in a buoy/waterproof pouch). Pool swimming has no GPX to record; real pool support arrives with the Watch phase (HealthKit lap counting). Don't build a manual-entry pool mode now.

### ActivitiesJournal (.NET)

- [x] `ActivitiesJournal.Tests/SportTypesTests.cs` — failing tests for Run/Swim filtering + labels (test-first)
- [x] `Models/ActivityType.cs` — add `Run`, `Swim`
- [x] `Constants.cs` (`SportTypes`) — add `Run = { "Run", "VirtualRun", "TrailRun" }`, `Swim = { "Swim" }`, `IsRun`/`IsSwim`, `FilterByType` cases, `TypeLabel` ("Runs", "Swims"). Without this, synced Strava runs fall into the default "Ride" bucket.
- [x] `dotnet test` green

**Deferred (not phase 1):** surfacing Run/Swim in ActivitiesJournal's analytics dropdowns/views — the web UI is Ride/Walk-centric and touching those views is its own task.

## Phase 2 — Upload to Strava

### Architecture decision: upload **server-side via ActivitiesJournal** (recommended)

| | A. Via ActivitiesJournal (recommended) | B. Direct from the app |
|---|---|---|
| OAuth/token handling | Already exists (`TokenStore`, refresh flow, `StravaController`) — only needs the `activity:write` scope added | Must build OAuth + secure token storage in Flutter from scratch |
| Secrets | Client secret stays server-side | Client secret shipped in the app binary |
| Code path | One upload from the phone; server fans out | Two independent uploads, two failure modes on the phone |
| Fits stack preference | .NET ✔ | — |
| Downside | Owner must re-authorize once with the new scope; phone upload requires the server to be up | Works offline from the server |

**Decision: A.** The app already trusts ActivitiesJournal as its single upload target; extend that.

### Attribution ("uploaded from Track") — options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Track ID in the **title** | Immediately visible | Clutters the feed headline followers see; lost the moment the title is edited; looks bot-like |
| Line in the **description** | Visible on the activity page but not in the feed; human-readable | Overwritten if the user edits the description; not machine-parseable reliably |
| **`external_id`** upload parameter | Purpose-built for exactly this; invisible to viewers; queryable via API; stable | Not visible anywhere in Strava's UI |
| GPX `<creator>` attribute | Zero clutter; Strava sometimes shows it as the recording device | Strava's device parsing is a whitelist — unknown creators are usually ignored; unreliable |

**Decision: `external_id = track-<activityId>` + one description line** ("Recorded with Track"). The `external_id` is the load-bearing part: ActivitiesJournal syncs activities *back* from Strava, so a track uploaded to Strava will reappear in the next sync. With `external_id`, the sync can recognise it as its own track — enabling dedup/linking, and directly feeding the planned Strava-vs-Track comparison view. The description line is purely for humans and losing it costs nothing.

### Steps

- [ ] `StravaController` OAuth: request `activity:read_all,activity:write`; owner re-authorizes once
- [ ] `IStravaService.UploadActivityAsync(gpx, sportType, name, description, externalId)` → `POST /api/v3/uploads` (multipart, `data_type=gpx`). Upload is **async** on Strava's side: poll `GET /uploads/{id}` until `activity_id` is set or an error is returned (Strava rejects duplicates at this step — surface that as a distinct result, not a failure)
- [ ] Sport type mapping: `Ride→Ride`, `Walk→Walk`, `Run→Run`, `Swim→Swim`, `Football→Soccer`
- [ ] `TracksController.Upload`: optional `uploadToStrava` form field; store the resulting Strava activity id in `TrackSummary`
- [ ] Track app: "Also upload to Strava" toggle on the upload flow (persist last choice in SharedPreferences); show per-destination result
- [ ] Tests: NUnit for the upload service (mock HTTP, poll loop, duplicate response) and mapping; Flutter test for the upload-flag plumbing
- [ ] Later (separate task): use `external_id` during Strava sync to link/dedup synced copies of Track uploads

## Phase 3 — UI rework (Claude Design)

Prompt lives in [DESIGN_PROMPT.md](./DESIGN_PROMPT.md).

- [ ] Run the prompt at claude.ai/design; iterate until the design system feels right
- [ ] Translate tokens → Flutter `ThemeData` (colors, type scale, spacing, radii) in a single `lib/theme.dart`
- [ ] Rework screens in order of visibility: Record → Home → Activity detail → Planned routes → Settings
- [ ] Keep the recording pipeline untouched — this phase is presentation-only
- [ ] Verify in bright-light conditions (the app is used outdoors on a bike)

---

## Phase 4 — Apple Watch

Full plan in [WATCH_PLAN.md](./WATCH_PLAN.md). Summary: Flutter has no watchOS support, so the watch app is native SwiftUI added as a target to `ios/Runner`, talking to Flutter over `WatchConnectivity`. Three sub-phases: remote control → standalone recording with heart rate → swim support (which finally makes pool swimming real).

## Suggested session boundaries

| Session | Work |
|---|---|
| 1 | Phase 1 (both repos, test-first) |
| 2 | Phase 2 server side (OAuth scope, upload service, endpoint) |
| 3 | Phase 2 app side + end-to-end test with a real activity |
| 4 | Phase 3 design generation + theme tokens |
| 5+ | Phase 3 screen-by-screen; then Phase 4 per WATCH_PLAN.md |
